### Tested browsers & devices: 

* FireFox 44

### Current Features
This application is currently in beta. As new features are completed, I will list them here. At the moment, you can **add**, **edit** and **delete** notes. I also added an **export** feature which exports the application data to json. This feature was essential, since the data schema has been in constant flux during development.
