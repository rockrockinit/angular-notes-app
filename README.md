A notes application built with **AngularJS** using **Firebase** for the backend. **[Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/)** (an implementeation Google's Material Design Specification) was used for the frontend user interface.

### Tested browsers & devices: 

* FireFox 44

* Safari 9
* iOS 9.2

### Current Features
This application is currently in beta. As new features are completed, they will be listed here. At the moment, you can **add**, **edit** and **delete** notes. I also added an **export** feature which exports the application data to json. This feature was essential, since the data schema has been in a constant flux during development.
