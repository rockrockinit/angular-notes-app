A notes application built with **AngularJS** using **Firebase** for the backend. **[Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/)** (an implementeation Google's Material Design Specification) was used for the frontend user interface.

##Overview

This application works responsively on both mobile and desktop browsers. It encrypts user notes and [saves](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/saving-data.html) them them to reference objects using the Firebase API. Users are also managed through Firebase with their simple [Email & Password Authentication](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/login/password.html).

### Features
This application is currently in beta. As new features are completed, they will be listed here. At the moment, you can **add**, **edit** and **delete** notes. I also added an **export** feature which exports the application data to json. This feature was essential, since the data schema has been in a constant flux during development.
